        <h2>About HTML 5</h2>

        <article>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— Only this and nothing more.”<br>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow. From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore— For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore— Nameless here for evermore.</article>

        <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— This it is and nothing more.”<br>
          
              Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
          “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
              But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
              And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
          That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
                      Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
